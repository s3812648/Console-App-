### Design patterns used:

        - Builder: is used to build Student objects

        - Singleton: is used to create and maintain only 1 instance of the MemoryStudentEnrollmentManager class

        - Visitor: is used to provide the ability to check for duplicated object (CheckDuplicated Visitor)
                    from a list of objects of 3 different classes Student, Course and StudentEnrollment

        - Command: is used to dispense command to CRUD StudentEnrollment objects and provide undo ability

        - Chain of Responsibility: a chain of instances to print student enrollment data based on
                                    the correct criteria (studentId/courseId/semester)

        - Composite: the Course class holds an array list of Course itself

        - Iterator: is used to create the class StudentList

        - Facade: is used to implement getStudentId() and getCourseId() from Student and Course into StudentEnrollment

        - Dependency Injection: is used to inject Student and Class into StudentEnrollment (constructor and setters)

        - Factory: is used to create objects of class Course
